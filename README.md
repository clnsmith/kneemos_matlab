# kneemos_matlab
A set of matlab codes for reading and analyzing musculoskeletal simulations performed in SIMM and OpenSim. 

The code was orginally developed by the KNEE MOdeling and Simulation (KNEEMOS) subgroup in the UW Neuromuscular Biomechanics Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (http://uwnmbl.engr.wisc.edu/). Continued development is a collaboration between the UWNMBL and the Laboratory for Movement Biomechanics at ETH Zurich (http://www.movement.ethz.ch/).
